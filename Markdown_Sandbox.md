#Markdown Sandbox

This is a sandbox file demonstrating various markdown commands. 
You can take a look at the raw text and the corresponding rendering for various examples below. 
The examples here are a practice exercise for me, and are based on the following tutorial:

* [http://markdowntutorial.com/](http://markdowntutorial.com/)

_Let's begin:_

### Contents:
[Emphasis](#emphasis)  
[Headers](#headers)  
[Links](#links)  
[Images](#images)  
[Blockquotes](#blockquotes)
[Lists](#lists)  
[Paragraphs](#paragraphs)


#### _Emphasis_

A **single** bold word and a _single_ word in italics.  
**Some more words** in bold and a _few more_ in italics.  
Finally they **_tango together_**.

#### Headers

Here are examples of different types of headers:
# Level _One_
## Level _Two_
### Level _Three_
#### Level _Four_
##### Level _Five_
###### Level _Six_


#### Links

A Link can either be an inline links like [this one](http://www.example.com) or a reference link like [this one][ref 1].  
In addition also take a look at how the entries in the [contents section](#contents) link to different parts of this document.

[ref 1]: http://www.google.com

#### Images

Just like links images can either be inline like this one:  
![inline image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)  
or with a reference link like this one  
![reference image][reference image link]

#### Blockquotes

> Blockquotes can be used to call special attention to a quote
>
> By ppropriately using the '>' symbol multiple lines can appear as one blockquote.

#### Lists

Lists can be ordered, like this:
1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three

or unordered, like this:
* Apples
* Oranges
* Bananas

You can also have multi level lists like this:
* Top level
 * Sub level
 * Sub level
   * Sub sub level
    * Sub sub level

or this:

1. Top level
 2. Sub level
   3. Sub level
    4. Sub sub level

You can even have text between the levels like this:

1. Top level  
 Then some description and then
 2. The sub level

#### Paragraphs

You can either have hard breaks between lines like this line...

..and this line.

OR

You can have soft breaks between lines, like this line  
and this one. (This requires you to have two 'spaces' at the end of the previous line).


...and that's it.

For some additional features (some non-standard) you can look at this cheatsheet:

#Markdown Sandbox

This is a sandbox file demonstrating various markdown commands. 
You can take a look at the raw text and the corresponding rendering for various examples below. 
The examples here are a practice exercise for me, and are based on the following tutorials:

* [http://markdowntutorial.com/](http://markdowntutorial.com/)
* [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

_Let's begin:_

### Contents:
[Emphasis](#emphasis)  
[Headers](#headers)  
[Links](#links)  
[Images](#images)  
[Blockquotes](#blockquotes)


#### _Emphasis_

A **single** bold word and a _single_ word in italics.  
**Some more words** in bold and a _few more_ in italics.  
Finally they **_tango together_**.

#### Headers

Here are examples of different types of headers:
# Level _One_
## Level _Two_
### Level _Three_
#### Level _Four_
##### Level _Five_
###### Level _Six_


#### Links

A Link can either be an inline links like [this one](http://www.example.com) or a reference link like [this one][ref 1].  
In addition also take a look at how the entries in the [contents section](#contents) link to different parts of this document.

[ref 1]: http://www.google.com

#### Images

Just like links images can either be inline like this one:  
![inline image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)  
or with a reference link like this one  
![reference image][reference image link]

#### Blockquotes

> Blockquotes can be used to call special attention to a quote
>
> By ppropriately using the '>' symbol multiple lines can appear as one blockquote.
